# Changelog

## [4.0.0]
### Breaking
- Renamed argument `filepath` of methods `write_xml`, `TestSuite.write`, and `JUnitXml.write`
  to `file_or_filename`, as these methods now support file objects and file-like objects.
- Turned positional argument `pretty` of methods `write_xml`, `TestSuite.write`, and `JUnitXml.write` into keyword argument.
  Use as `write_xml(obj, filename, pretty=True)` and `obj.write(filename, pretty=True)`, respectively.
- Removed argument `to_console` from methods `write_xml`, `TestSuite.write`, and `JUnitXml.write`.
  Instead, use `write_xml(obj, sys.stdout)` and `obj.write(sys.stdout)`, respectively.
- Renamed argument `filepath` of method `JUnitXml.fromfile` to `file`,
  to reflect that this method supports file objects, file-like objects, and urls.
- Setter method `TestCase.result` used to ignore values of invalid types. This method now throws a `ValueError` instead.
- Method `xunit2.TestCase.add_rerun_result` has been renamed to `add_interim_result` result to better reflect class hierarchy
  of interim (rerun and flaky) results.
